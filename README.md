The Harris County criminal system is rife with disparities. Despite making up just 19% of the population, black people comprised 45% of bookings in Harris County jail from 2015-2018 [1]. Nationally, this is in line with disparities in criminal justice outcomes, which tends to favor white, affluent defendants over people of color and lower-income defendants [2]. This paper aims to employ machine learning techniques to investigate what demographic outcomes are predictive of harsher sentencing in Harris County. We leverage a robust publicly available dataset from the Harris County Clerkâ€™s Office with over 200,000 Harris County Court case outcomes to create multivariate regression models. First, we estimate sentencing harshness based solely on the facts of the case, then we estimate the effect of defendant demographics on sentencing outcomes. Including defendant demographics in our model does not improve model performance, suggesting more work to be done for machines to accurately estimate disparities.
